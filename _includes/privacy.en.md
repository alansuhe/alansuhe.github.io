"{{ include.appName }}" (collectively referred to below as “the App”) respects and protects the privacy of every user who uses our services. To provide you with more accurate and personalized services, the App will use and disclose your personal information only as described in this Privacy Policy. We treat such information with the highest degree of diligence and care. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, the App will not disclose or share your information with any third party without your prior consent. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
By agreeing to the App’s Terms of Service, you are deemed to have accepted all provisions of this Privacy Policy in their entirety.

## 1. Scope  

When you use the App’s services, the App may receive and record information stored on your device, including but not limited to your language settings, access date and time, hardware and software characteristics, and records of your requests.  

The App may also obtain personal data about you from our business partners through lawful channels.  

You understand and agree that the following information is not covered by this Privacy Policy:  
- Keywords you enter while using the App’s input or editing features;  
- Information you have published on other channels, including but not limited to information about activities you participate in, transaction details, and reviews;  
- Any unlawful conduct or violations of the App’s rules, along with the measures taken against you.

## 2. Use of Information  

The App will not provide, sell, rent, share, or trade your personal information to any unrelated third party unless we have obtained your explicit prior consent or the third party and the App jointly provide a service to you. In the latter case, the third party will be prohibited from accessing all such information once the service is completed.  

The App also forbids any third party from collecting, editing, selling, or freely disseminating your personal information by any means. If any user of the App is found engaging in such activities, the App reserves the right to terminate the user’s service agreement immediately.  

The Android version of the App retrieves a list of installed applications during initialization in order to detect whether Google Play Services are present, thereby determining the appropriate method for enabling in-app purchases. This information is never used for any other purpose, nor is it stored or distributed.

## 3. Disclosure of Information  

The App may disclose your personal information—either in whole or in part—when:  
- You have given prior consent to such disclosure;  
- Disclosure is necessary to provide the products or services you have requested;  
- Disclosure is required by applicable laws or by administrative or judicial authorities;  
- You have violated relevant Chinese laws, regulations, the App’s Terms of Service, or related rules, making disclosure to a third party necessary;  
- You are a qualified intellectual-property complainant who has filed a complaint, and disclosure to the respondent is required in order to address the potential dispute;  
- In a transaction created on the App, if a party has fulfilled or partially fulfilled its obligations and requests disclosure, the App may decide to provide the requesting party with the other party’s contact information or other necessary details to facilitate the transaction or resolve any dispute;  
- Any other disclosure deemed appropriate under applicable laws, regulations, or the App’s policies.

## 4. Data Storage and Transfer  

The information and materials collected about you will be stored on the App’s servers. They may be transferred to—and accessed, stored, or displayed in—countries or regions outside the one in which the information was originally collected, provided such transfer is necessary to provide or improve our services or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
