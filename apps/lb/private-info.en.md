This software respects and protects the personal privacy rights of all users of its services. In order to provide you with more accurate and personalized services, this software will use and disclose your personal information in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy. The software will handle such information with the utmost diligence and care. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, without your prior permission, the software will not disclose such information to the public or provide it to any third party. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. By agreeing to the Service Terms of this software, you are deemed to have agreed to the entire content of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is an inseparable part of the “Listen Bot” (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Software”) Service Terms.

1. Scope of Application
When you use the services of the Software, it may receive and record information from your device, including but not limited to the language you use, access date and time, software and hardware feature information, and records of your requests.

The Software may also obtain user personal data through lawful means from business partners.

You understand and agree that the following information is not subject to this Privacy Policy:

The keyword information you input when using the data entry or editing functions provided by the Software.

Information and data about you collected by the Software from other channels, including but not limited to participation in events, transaction information, and review details.

Any acts that violate laws or regulations or the rules of the Software, as well as the measures taken by the Software against you in such cases.

2. Use of Information
The Software will not provide, sell, rent, share, or trade your personal information to any unrelated third party unless you have given explicit prior consent, or such third party and the Software jointly provide services to you. In such cases, the third party will be prohibited from accessing all such information once the service ends.

The Software also strictly prohibits any third party from collecting, editing, selling, or freely distributing your personal information by any means. If any user of the Software is found to be engaging in such activities, the Software has the right to immediately terminate its service agreement with that user.

The Android version of the Software may retrieve the list of installed applications during initialization and related processes. This is solely for the purpose of determining whether the Google Play Store framework is installed, so as to decide the method for enabling in-app purchase functionality. This information will never be used for other purposes, stored, or distributed.

3. Disclosure of Information
The Software will fully or partially disclose your personal information in the following circumstances based on your consent or as required by law:

With your prior consent, disclose to a third party.

To provide the products and services you request, disclose to a third party as necessary.

Disclose to a third party or relevant authorities in accordance with applicable laws or at the request of administrative or judicial bodies.

If you violate Chinese laws, regulations, or the Software’s Service Terms or related rules, disclosure may be made to third parties.

If you are a qualified intellectual property complainant who has filed a complaint, your information may be disclosed to the respondent at their request to facilitate resolution of a potential rights dispute.

In the case of a transaction created on the Software’s platform, if either party has fulfilled or partially fulfilled its contractual obligations and requests information disclosure, the Software has the right to provide necessary contact information of the counterparty to facilitate completion of the transaction or resolution of a dispute.

Any other disclosures deemed appropriate by the Software under laws, regulations, or platform policies.

4. Information Storage and Transfer
The information and data collected by the Software about you will be stored on the Software’s servers. Such information and data may be transmitted to, accessed, stored, and displayed in countries or regions outside your own or the place where the information was collected. This will only occur if it is necessary for providing or improving our services, or for complying with applicable legal requirements.
